# CMSS Trello-Style Board Revamp — Phase A

Status: Plan approved; SSOT created at `docs/CMSS_REVAMP_PLAN.md`
Required model tier: Opus 4.8 Max or GPT-5.5 Extra High
Phase: CMSS Kanban revamp — Phase A (task board with drag & drop)
Risk: High (RBAC scoping, workflow-adjacent state changes, schema migration)
SRS IDs: `REQ-RBAC-001`, `UI-SCREEN-001`, `UI-DESIGN-001`,
`REQ-LOCALIZATION-001`, `METHOD-TEST-001`

## Task

Execute Phase A of `docs/CMSS_REVAMP_PLAN.md` (the SSOT — read it first),
task by task. A1 + A2 + A3 are DONE (backend complete). **Next task: A4.**

- A1 (done): Prisma migration — `BoardStage`, `Task.stageId?`, `Task.boardPosition`,
  seed default TASKS stages.
- A2 (done): `GET /tasks/board` session-scoped read + scoping tests; OpenAPI documented.
- A3 (done): `POST /tasks/:id/move` — stage→status derivation, same-tx history+audit,
  PATCH-shared note/next-action invariants, allowed+denied tests; OpenAPI documented.
  33/33 tasks tests + lint/typecheck/openapi:check Passed.
- A4 (next): add `@dnd-kit/core` + `@dnd-kit/sortable`; generate the shadcn
  primitives the board needs (avatar, tooltip, sheet, scroll-area, popover) via the
  shadcn CLI (`npx shadcn add …` — never hand-roll); add board design tokens to the
  existing token system. Keep to dependency + primitives + tokens; no board page yet
  (that is A6).
- A5–A8: typed `lib/staff-board-api.ts` client + move server action; `/tasks/board`
  Kanban page (Trello UX, RTL, all states, i18n en+ar, nav entry); mobile pass;
  visual/a11y/e2e proofs. UI tasks must render + screenshot + self-review before done.

Constraints (locked decisions):
- Ticket stages (Phase B) are mapped columns over the existing complaint
  state machine — never bypass `POST /complaints/:id/transitions`.
- Boards ship alongside existing screens; old screens stay.
- Board reads are scoped from the server session only.
- Each task ≈ 1–5 files + tests; mark `[x]` in the SSOT after each task.

## Verification

Per task: `corepack pnpm lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, `test:api -- <suite>`,
`openapi:generate` + `openapi:check` on route changes; UI tasks additionally
`test:visual`, `test:e2e -- accessibility`, `web:visual-review` (en + ar).
High-risk tasks record the security self-check in `.forge/evidence.md`.

## Carry-Forward (from prior next.md — release automation)

- Needs Human Review: add repository deploy secrets (`DEPLOY_HOST`,
  `DEPLOY_USER`, `DEPLOY_KEY`, `DEPLOY_PATH`) in GitHub settings.
- Needs Human Review: create the `production` branch to trigger the
  auto-deploy pipeline (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`), then run
  authenticated production smoke.
