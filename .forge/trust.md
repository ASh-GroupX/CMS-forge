# Trust Log

Append review decisions here.

## INIT - Forge Initialized

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Low
- Recommendation: Accept
- Notes:
  - Clean protocol initialized.
  - No implementation code changed.
  - Current project truth starts at `state.md` and `next.md`.

## SRS-REVIEW-001 - Contract Clarifications

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Medium
- Recommendation: Accept
- Notes:
  - The review findings were valid.
  - The patch stayed limited to contract clarification, not new implementation.

## SRS-UI-001 - Modern UI/UX Contract

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Medium
- Recommendation: Accept
- Notes:
  - The SRS now makes modern operational UI/UX enforceable.
  - Dark mode remains Phase 2; MVP tokens must not block it later.

## SRS-UI-002 - UI Gate Wiring

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Low
- Recommendation: Accept
- Notes:
  - The UI quality bar is now present in MVP gates, QA coverage, scope control, and Forge planning.

## FORGE-QUALITY-001 - Agent Build Guardrails

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Low
- Recommendation: Accept
- Notes:
  - This makes the Forge workflow less dependent on prose-only conventions.

## PLAN-F0-01 - Scaffold Build Task

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Low
- Recommendation: Accept
- Notes:
  - Planning is now aligned with the agreed order: rulebook, scaffold, data model, generator, golden CRUD, then feature modules.

## F0-01 - Monorepo Scaffold And Toolchain Foundation

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Medium
- Recommendation: Accept
- Notes:
  - The change stayed inside scaffold scope and avoided domain behavior.
  - Required F0-01 verification commands ran and passed after installing dependencies.
  - Pending proof scripts fail loudly instead of pretending API, visual, security, DB, backup, or performance coverage exists.

## F0-02 - Real Toolchain Proof Scripts

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Medium
- Recommendation: Accept
- Notes:
  - The lint gate is now a real static check, not just a file-existence check.
  - Required verification commands ran and passed.
  - This remains a baseline gate; full ESLint, dependency-cruiser, coverage, visual, accessibility, and performance gates remain scheduled for F0-06.

## F0-03 - Docker Local Stack For API And Web

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Medium
- Recommendation: Accept
- Notes:
  - All five proof commands (install --lockfile-only, lint, typecheck, test, openapi:check) passed.
  - Docker Compose config validation passed (exit 0).
  - Liveness entrypoints contain no domain behavior; Docker image build is deferred until a developer runs it locally.
  - `docker compose build` ran successfully in the F0-04 session, producing `cms-forge-api:latest` and `cms-forge-web:latest`. F0-03 risk resolved.

## F0-04 - Seed Data For Branches, Roles, Users, Categories, Vehicles, Complaints

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Medium
- Recommendation: Accept
- Notes:
  - All six proof commands passed.
  - Seed ran end-to-end inside Docker network; data verified with psql.
  - Role codes and complaint states derived directly from SRS RBAC-MATRIX-001 and WORKFLOW-MATRIX-001 — no invented codes.
  - Remaining risk: `POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD: trust` exposes local postgres without a password. Acceptable for dev; must not reach production. Flag for a future infra hardening task.
  - F0-08 will expand this minimal schema into the full coherent data model before Phase 2 feature migrations.

## F0-05 - Frontend Design Tokens And Shared UI Component Foundation

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Low
- Recommendation: Accept
- Notes:
  - Only design token constants, global CSS, and configuration files were added.
  - All proof scripts successfully passed.

## PLAN-F0-06 - Phase 0 Quality Gates

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Medium
- Recommendation: Accept
- Notes:
  - The planned task tightens gates without adding heavyweight tooling before there is enough application code to justify it.
  - UI, accessibility, and performance commands must remain honest fail-loud gates until real screens exist; they must not be reported as passed in F0-06.

## F0-06 - Phase 0 Quality Gates

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Medium
- Recommendation: Accept
- Notes:
  - Required verification commands ran and passed.
  - The implementation used existing Node tooling only, preserving the task's dependency discipline.
  - Remaining risk: fail-loud UI/perf commands are not real visual, accessibility, or performance coverage yet; this is acceptable until MVP screens exist.

## F0-07 - Module Generator Template And Golden CRUD Designation

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Medium
- Recommendation: Accept
- Notes:
  - Required verification commands ran and passed.
  - The generator is intentionally dependency-free and structural only; it does not create runtime Nest decorators until the Nest package baseline exists.
  - Remaining risk: generated skeletons are construction-only placeholders, not CRUD behavior. `branches` remains scheduled as the actual golden CRUD exemplar in F1-05.
