# Trust Log

Append review decisions here.

## INIT - Forge Initialized

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Low
- Recommendation: Accept
- Notes:
  - Clean protocol initialized.
  - No implementation code changed.
  - Current project truth starts at `state.md` and `next.md`.

## SRS-REVIEW-001 - Contract Clarifications

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Medium
- Recommendation: Accept
- Notes:
  - The review findings were valid.
  - The patch stayed limited to contract clarification, not new implementation.

## SRS-UI-001 - Modern UI/UX Contract

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Medium
- Recommendation: Accept
- Notes:
  - The SRS now makes modern operational UI/UX enforceable.
  - Dark mode remains Phase 2; MVP tokens must not block it later.

## SRS-UI-002 - UI Gate Wiring

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Low
- Recommendation: Accept
- Notes:
  - The UI quality bar is now present in MVP gates, QA coverage, scope control, and Forge planning.

## FORGE-QUALITY-001 - Agent Build Guardrails

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Low
- Recommendation: Accept
- Notes:
  - This makes the Forge workflow less dependent on prose-only conventions.

## PLAN-F0-01 - Scaffold Build Task

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Low
- Recommendation: Accept
- Notes:
  - Planning is now aligned with the agreed order: rulebook, scaffold, data model, generator, golden CRUD, then feature modules.

## F0-01 - Monorepo Scaffold And Toolchain Foundation

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Medium
- Recommendation: Accept
- Notes:
  - The change stayed inside scaffold scope and avoided domain behavior.
  - Required F0-01 verification commands ran and passed after installing dependencies.
  - Pending proof scripts fail loudly instead of pretending API, visual, security, DB, backup, or performance coverage exists.

## F0-02 - Real Toolchain Proof Scripts

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Medium
- Recommendation: Accept
- Notes:
  - The lint gate is now a real static check, not just a file-existence check.
  - Required verification commands ran and passed.
  - This remains a baseline gate; full ESLint, dependency-cruiser, coverage, visual, accessibility, and performance gates remain scheduled for F0-06.

## F0-03 - Docker Local Stack For API And Web

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Medium
- Recommendation: Accept
- Notes:
  - All five proof commands (install --lockfile-only, lint, typecheck, test, openapi:check) passed.
  - Docker Compose config validation passed (exit 0).
  - Liveness entrypoints contain no domain behavior; Docker image build is deferred until a developer runs it locally.
  - Remaining risk: Docker image build itself was not exercised in this session. Recommend running `docker compose build` in the dev environment before F0-04.
