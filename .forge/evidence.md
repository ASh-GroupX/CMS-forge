## INIT - Forge Initialized

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Low
- Status: Passed
- Evidence:
  - Created clean Forge files for CMS-Auto.
  - Used `docs/CMS_AUTO_SRS.md` as source of truth.
  - Did not copy stale Buildra history or legacy prompt wrappers.

## SRS-REVIEW-001 - Contract Clarifications

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Medium
- Status: Passed
- Evidence:
  - Patched `docs/CMS_AUTO_SRS.md` to clarify compensation RBAC, reject transitions, parallel approvals, CSAT scale, inquiry/suggestion/feedback handling, portal anti-abuse, password reset UI, in-app notifications UI, attachment defaults, RTO, DMS multiple matches, management masking, first-response KPI source, total complaint SLA target, and optimistic concurrency for complaint updates.
  - Verified the new clauses are present with `rg`.

## SRS-UI-001 - Modern UI/UX Contract

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Medium
- Status: Passed
- Evidence:
  - Added `UI-DESIGN-001` to `docs/CMS_AUTO_SRS.md`.
  - Locked MVP UI stack to Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Radix UI, and Lucide icons.
  - Added design tokens, shared components, required UI states, responsive widths, WCAG AA, visual regression, and frontend performance gates.
  - Wired UI quality into milestone planning and final sign-off.

## SRS-UI-002 - UI Gate Wiring

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Low
- Status: Passed
- Evidence:
  - Added UI/UX quality to MVP acceptance gates.
  - Added `QA-UI-001` for visual, accessibility, UI state, responsive, and frontend performance coverage.
  - Added Dark mode as Phase 2 in the scope table.
  - Updated `.forge/next.md` to require `test:visual` and `web:perf` scripts in the first scaffold plan.

## FORGE-QUALITY-001 - Agent Build Guardrails

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Low
- Status: Passed
- Evidence:
  - Updated Forge backlog and first task to prioritize enforceable gates, module generator/scaffold, and a golden CRUD reference module.
  - Recorded that auth/audit are special-case modules and should not be the normal CRUD reference.

## F0-00 - Agent Rulebook And Architecture Blueprint

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Low
- Status: Passed
- Evidence:
  - Created `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: module pattern, enforced dependency direction, canonical audit/RBAC/error/transaction/job patterns, enforcement gates, and the structural-skeleton vs golden-CRUD split.
  - Created `CLAUDE.md` and identical `AGENTS.md` with the short agent build rules.
  - Wired both into `.forge/forge.md` Read First and PLAN inputs so every Forge run loads the how-layer, not just the SRS and next task.
  - Drawn from SRS `METHOD-*`, `ARCH-*`, §14, and §23; consistent with the contract.
