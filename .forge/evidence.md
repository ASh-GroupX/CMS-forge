# Evidence Log

Append build and verification evidence here. Do not delete failed evidence.

## INIT - Forge Initialized

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Low
- Status: Passed
- Evidence:
  - Created clean Forge files for CMS-Auto.
  - Used `docs/CMS_AUTO_SRS.md` as source of truth.
  - Did not copy stale Buildra history or legacy prompt wrappers.

## SRS-REVIEW-001 - Contract Clarifications

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Medium
- Status: Passed
- Evidence:
  - Patched `docs/CMS_AUTO_SRS.md` to clarify compensation RBAC, reject transitions, parallel approvals, CSAT scale, inquiry/suggestion/feedback handling, portal anti-abuse, password reset UI, in-app notifications UI, attachment defaults, RTO, DMS multiple matches, management masking, first-response KPI source, total complaint SLA target, and optimistic concurrency for complaint updates.
  - Verified the new clauses are present with `rg`.

## SRS-UI-001 - Modern UI/UX Contract

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Medium
- Status: Passed
- Evidence:
  - Added `UI-DESIGN-001` to `docs/CMS_AUTO_SRS.md`.
  - Locked MVP UI stack to Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Radix UI, and Lucide icons.
  - Added design tokens, shared components, required UI states, responsive widths, WCAG AA, visual regression, and frontend performance gates.
  - Wired UI quality into milestone planning and final sign-off.

## SRS-UI-002 - UI Gate Wiring

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Low
- Status: Passed
- Evidence:
  - Added UI/UX quality to MVP acceptance gates.
  - Added `QA-UI-001` for visual, accessibility, UI state, responsive, and frontend performance coverage.
  - Added Dark mode as Phase 2 in the scope table.
  - Updated `.forge/next.md` to require `test:visual` and `web:perf` scripts in the first scaffold plan.

## FORGE-QUALITY-001 - Agent Build Guardrails

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Low
- Status: Passed
- Evidence:
  - Updated Forge backlog and first task to prioritize enforceable gates, module generator/scaffold, and a golden CRUD reference module.
  - Recorded that auth/audit are special-case modules and should not be the normal CRUD reference.

## F0-00 - Agent Rulebook And Architecture Blueprint

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Low
- Status: Passed
- Evidence:
  - Created `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: module pattern, enforced dependency direction, canonical audit/RBAC/error/transaction/job patterns, enforcement gates, and the structural-skeleton vs golden-CRUD split.
  - Created `CLAUDE.md` and identical `AGENTS.md` with the short agent build rules.
  - Wired both into `.forge/forge.md` Read First and PLAN inputs so every Forge run loads the how-layer, not just the SRS and next task.
  - Drawn from SRS `METHOD-*`, `ARCH-*`, §14, and §23; consistent with the contract.

## PLAN-F0-01 - Scaffold Build Task

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Low
- Status: Passed
- Evidence:
  - Moved coherent Prisma data model planning from Phase 2 to `F0-08`, before any feature migrations.
  - Replaced `.forge/next.md` with a buildable `F0-01` scaffold task.
  - Set `.forge/state.md` to `Ready to Build`.

## F0-01 - Monorepo Scaffold And Toolchain Foundation

- Date: 2026-06-18
- Risk: Medium
- Status: Passed
- Requirement IDs:
  - CONTRACT-READINESS-001
  - CONTRACT-READINESS-002
  - ARCH-STACK-001
  - ARCH-API-001
  - ARCH-DATA-001
  - UI-DESIGN-001
  - METHOD-MODULAR-001
  - METHOD-API-001
- Evidence:
  - Created the pnpm workspace root with `packageManager: pnpm@9.15.4`.
  - Added scaffold package boundaries for `apps/api`, `apps/web`, `packages/database`, `packages/contracts`, and `packages/config`.
  - Added strict TypeScript inheritance from `tsconfig.base.json`.
  - Added a minimal OpenAPI 3.1 contract shell at `packages/contracts/openapi.json`.
  - Added a Prisma schema shell with no domain tables.
  - Added `docker-compose.yml` with PostgreSQL and Redis only.
  - Exposed all SRS proof script names in root `package.json`.
  - Left non-F0-01 proof scripts as failing pending scripts so they cannot be mistaken for passed visual, API, security, backup, DB, or performance coverage.
- Verification:
  - Passed: `corepack pnpm install --lockfile-only`
  - Passed: `corepack pnpm install`
  - Passed: `corepack pnpm lint`
  - Passed: `corepack pnpm typecheck`
  - Passed: `corepack pnpm test`
  - Passed: `corepack pnpm openapi:check`
  - Passed: `corepack pnpm build`
- Notes:
  - Initial `corepack pnpm typecheck` failed before dependency installation because `--lockfile-only` does not create `node_modules`; after `corepack pnpm install`, the same command passed.
  - No domain behavior, auth logic, workflow logic, UI screens, module generator, or domain tables were added.
